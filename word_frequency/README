| Weekly Exercise 2: Unfair Dice
|---------------------------------------------

Included Files:
 * freq.py
 * README

Notes and Assumptions:
 
 The freq.py file contains the following three functions:

 * extract_file(): Checks if the command line arguments are valid, if not - it prints out an error
                   message and prints out the correct usage, if yes - it opens the input file and gives the list of the lines in the file

 * word_counter(): This function calculates the number of times a word appears in the input file,
                   and the frequency which is the ratio of the count of the word by the total number of words present. 
                   It returns a list "table" which contains the word, count and frequency as elements in lexicographic order.
 * output(): This function opens an output file and names it. Then it writes the elemnts of the
             table line by line in the output file.

The following assumptions are made:
# The input file given is located in the sam edirectory as freq.py
# The input file is a plaintext
# The ouput file destination is either empty or doesnot exist.

Running Instructions:

# Enter the name of the input file in the terminal in the following format:
  python3 freq.py <input_file_name>
  where <input_file_name> is name of the input file.
