# Assignments
This repository contains all the assignments code submissions that were completed as a part of the course CMPUT 274 taken at University of Alberta and instructed by Dr. Paul Lu.
I am extremely thankful for all the efforts put in by Dr. Paul Lu for designing these assignments which helped me understand the different concepts of programming and polish my programming skills, enabling me to write neat and efficient code.

# Files Included

All the folders containd each programs separate README which decribes the functionality of the code.


<h3>Password Validator </h3>
<h4>validator.py :</h4> 
This program features a password validator, which an inputted password. This program alos has the ability to generate a secure password of any length. This code uses functions  and random module from python

<h3>Unfair Dice: </h3>
<h4>unfairDice.py : </h4> 
This program calculates the frequencies of a biased dice for which the probablities are given and it also prints out a histogram for the frequencies of each side calculated which is scaled. This code uses concepts of probablities and loops.

<h3>Word Frequency </h3>
<h4>freq.py : </h4> 
This program reads in the input from a text file and counts the frequency of individual words and outputs the calculted frequency along with the words to an output text file. This code uses the concepts of classifiers and reading/writing to a file.

<h3>Text Preprocessor </h3>
<h4>preprocess.py : </h4>
This program takes in inputs from a text file and preprocesses the the text contained in it. It removes uneccesary characters from the text which would be useful for cleaning the text for use in machine learning. This code uses concepts of preprocessing, using command-line arguments and EOF Handling.

<h3>OO-Minimax </h3>
<h4>oominimax.py: </h4> 
This program features a Tic-Tac-Toe game which uses the famous minimax algorithm to decide the computers turn. This code uses the concepts of Object-oriented-Programming (OOP), minimax algorithm and recursion.

<h3>Dr. Moneybags <h3>
<h4>moneybags.py : </h4> 
This is a short program calculates the minimum wealth threshold from the provided number of applicants to be accepted in a club and their total net worth. The minimum threshold is chosen such that there are atleat as many members in the club as the minimum net worth for all of them. This code uses the concepts of efficient sorting algorithms and Big-O complexity

<h3>Huffman </h3>
<h4>util.py: </h4>
The file included is just a part of the files that were provided to us to complete the assignment. This file contains all the code which has been written by me solely. This program uses the concepts of intermediate OOP, compression, decompression, file I/O, huffman trees and binary search to display some data on a local host.
