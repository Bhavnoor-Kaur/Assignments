Notes and Assumptions:
 
 * biased_rolls(prob_list, s, n): Simulates n (integer) rolls of a biased m-sided die and return
                                  a list containing the results. This function takes a list containing
                                  the probablities of the m sides of the die and a seed value - 's' to
                                  determine the results.

 * draw_histogram(m, rolls, width): This function takes a list of 'rolls' as an argument and draws a
                                    frequency histogram of the rolls of an m-sided die
                                    mapped to a fixed width.
